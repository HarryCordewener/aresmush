"""What a spell does when it is cast at someone, from Foundry's spells.

Our spell catalogue (`pf2e_spells_*.yml`) describes a spell for a player to read and for a caster to
prepare. Casting one at a target needs what Foundry holds as data beside the prose: the defence it is
against - a save, basic or not, or AC for a spell attack - its damage and how that grows as it is
heightened, and its area. Those are written to `pf2e_spell_mechanics.yml`, keyed by the spell's name.

What a save's outcome does beyond damage is in the prose: Fear's failure leaves the target Frightened 2.
The prose links the condition it means (`@UUID[...conditionitems...]{Frightened 2}`), and the paragraph it
sits in says which outcome it is, so each outcome's conditions and effects are read from there. Every
outcome of a save happens to whoever rolled it, which is what makes the link enough.

Not every spell gives its outcomes paragraphs of their own. Daze says it in a sentence: "If the target
critically fails the save, it is also Stunned 1." So a sentence that names an outcome - "critically
fails", "on a failure", "on a success" - gives that outcome the conditions in the same clause, including
a numbered one written without a link ("or sickened 2 on a critical failure"). A failure's condition is
a critical failure's too, unless the sentence gives the critical failure its own.

And what an outcome does that is neither damage nor a condition - Command's "must use a single action
to do as you command" - is kept as its words (`outcome_text`), for the room to be told.

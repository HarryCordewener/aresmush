    # Whoever the engine is working on: a character, or a creature in an encounter.
    #
    # The two answer the same questions differently. A character's figures are built from their sheet;
    # a creature's are its stat block's numbers. A character carries gear, has feats, writes derived
    # values and hears about their own turn; a creature has abilities, is run by the GM and has only its
    # hit points. Foundry has the same split - one actor, with a character and an NPC beneath it.
    #
    # So each is an object answering the engine's questions, and the one place that asks which kind of
    # thing it has is `Actors.of`. Code that works on "whoever" asks the actor; it never asks whether
    # the actor is a creature.

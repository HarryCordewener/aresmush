    # What a condition stops someone doing, by what they try. Each row is what they are under, what of
    # their actions it is about, and what comes of trying: refused outright (`key`), or risked on a flat
    # check (`flat`) that loses the action where it fails.
    #
    #   Restrained   cannot use an action with the attack or manipulate trait, except to Escape or Force
    #                Open.
    #   Immobilized  cannot use an action with the move trait.
    #   Prone        the only actions with the move trait it can use are Crawl and Stand.
    #   Raging       cannot use an action with the concentrate trait that lacks the rage trait, but Seek.
    #   Fleeing      cannot Delay or Ready.
    #   Confused     cannot Delay, Ready or use a reaction.
    #   Grabbed      an action with the manipulate trait is lost on a failed DC 5 flat check.
    #   Deafened     an action with the auditory trait is lost on a failed DC 5 flat check.
    #   Stupefied    a spell is lost on a failed flat check against 5 and the condition's value.
